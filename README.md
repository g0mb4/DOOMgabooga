caveman port of DOOM

engine: https://github.com/alpinestudios/oogabooga

DOOM: https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric

## note
It needs a .wad file in the root directory (the shareware (doom1.wad) does the job).

Some memory related crashes are expected.

I hope I changed every `%s` to `%cs` in `printf()`, but it might not be the case.

## TODO
+ better input handling
+ sound
+ general cleanup
