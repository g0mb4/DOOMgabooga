caveman's port of DOOM

engine: https://github.com/alpinestudios/oogabooga

DOOM: https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric

## note
It needs a .wad file in the root directory (the shareware (DOOM1.WAD) does the job).

No "Stats" and "Entering" screens show at the and of the level, but it works.

Some memory related crashes are expected.

I hope I changed every `%s` to `%cs` in `printf()`, but it might not be the case.

No multiplayer.
